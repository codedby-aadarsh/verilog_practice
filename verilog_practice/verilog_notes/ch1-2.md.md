# verilog notes

so im going to write learning of this language in my words.

# introduction:

- verilog is a hardware description langauge, which is used to desgin or implement a hardware. and its not a programming language which defines the hardware how to function but here we are designing that hardware.
- design described in verilog are easy to read and debug, than the schematic. so we use the verilog for genrating the netlist that is it defines the gate level connection for the design when converted.
- verilog have two type of the design methodology which is **top to bottom or bottom to top design,** in which we divide the design in the fundamental block and design them seperatly and then combines them.
- All behavior code should be described within the keywords `module` and `endmodule`. Rest of the design code would mostly follow the given template.

```verilog
module [design_name] ( [port_list] );

	[list_of_input_ports]
	[list_of_output_ports]

	[declaration_of_other_signals]

	[other_module_instantiations_if_required]

	[behavioral_code_for_this_module]
endmodule
```

- so as you can see above thats how we design or implement a hardware by defining the name of the hardware and list of the input and output parameters , then we define the behaviour of the module inside the block and terminates the `module` with the `endmodule` keyword as these are necessary to do so.
- there are generally **four level of abstraction** in verilog:
    1. **switch level** : here the switches are actual mos transistor like pmos and nmos , and it uses pmos( input paramter s) like statements inside the module block to design.
    2. **register transfer level/data flow level** :here it makes the use of the boolean expression to make connections between the register and the author knows how the signal flows between the registers.
    3. **gate level** : in this one building blocks are “and, or ,not” gates and defines the connections between those gates.
    4. **algorithmic level/behaviour level** : this one have syntax like c and uses the if else case statements mostly, to define the logic in module.
- **module instantiation** : before we saw the module declaration, but modules provides us the template from which we can create the real objects, like a d flip flop module defination defines how it works, but to actually use that we have to create the instances of that template.
- **testbenches** : so testbench is a code which helps us in testing our verilog code which we have written and would like to see if it works as expected. so we provide our code with the **stimuli**  which provides the input to our code to run , just like you power the circuit to run it , its works on same logic and we see the output graphs based on the input combinations.

# lexical conventions in verilog

```verilog
1. whitespace:
-> whitespace between the tokens count and used for seperating and otherwise ignored, they are count when used in strings.
module tff //whitespace between this tokens counts
"ea rth" // here too the whitespace gets count.

2. comments:
// This is a single line comment
integer a;   // Creates an int variable called a, and treats everything to the right of // as a comment
/*
This is a
multiple-line or
block comment
*/

3. operators:
x = ~y;                // ~ is a unary operator, and y is the operand
x = y | z;             // | is a binary operator, where y and z are its operands
x = (y > 5) ? w : z;   // ?: is a ternary operator, and the expression (y>5), w and z are its operands

4.numbers :
16          // Number 16 in decimal
0x10        // Number 16 in hexadecimal
10000       // Number 16 in binary
20          // Number 16 in octal

->Sized numbers are represented as shown below, where size is written only in decimal to specify the number of bits in the number.

->[size]'[base_format][number]
base_format can be either decimal ('d or 'D), hexadecimal ('h or 'H) and octal ('o or 'O) and specifies what base the number part represents.

3'b010;     // size is 3, base format is binary ('b), and the number is 010 (indicates value 2 in binary)
3'd2;       // size is 3, base format is decimal ('d) and the number is 2 (specified in decimals)
8'h70;      // size is 8, base format is hexadecimal ('h) and the number is 0x70 (in hex) to represent decimal 112
9'h1FA;     // size is 9, base format is hexadecimal ('h) and the number is 0x1FA (in hex) to represent decimal 506

4'hA = 4'd10 = 4'b1010 = 4'o12	// Decimal 10 can be represented in any of the four formats
8'd234 = 8'D234                 // Legal to use either lower case or upper case for base format
32'hFACE_47B2;                  // Underscore (_) can be used to separate 16 bit numbers for readability

Uppercase letters are legal for number specification when the base format is hexadecimal.

16'hcafe;         // lowercase letters Valid
16'hCAFE;         // uppercase letters Valid
32'h1D40_CAFE;    // underscore can be used as separator between 4 letters Valid

->unsized Numbers without a base_format specification are decimal numbers by default. Numbers without a size specification have a default number of bits depending on the type of simulator and machine.

integer a = 5423;       // base format is not specified, a gets a decimal value of 5423
integer a = 'h1AD7;     // size is not specified, because a is int (32 bits) value stored in a = 32'h0000_1AD7

Negative numbers are specified by placing a minus - sign before the size of a number. It is illegal to have a minus sign between base_format and number.

-6'd3;            // 8-bit negative number stored as two's complement of 3
-6'sd9;           // For signed maths
8'd-4;            // Illegal
5. strings :
A sequence of characters enclosed in a double quote " " is called a string. It cannot be split into multiple lines and every character in the string take 1-byte to be stored.

"Hello World!"        // String with 12 characters -> require 12 bytes
"x + z"               // String with 5 characters

"How are you
feeling today ?"      // Illegal for a string to be split into multiple lines
6. identifiers: 
->Identifiers are names of variables so that they can be referenced later on. They are made up of alphanumeric characters [a-z][A-Z][0-9], underscores _ or dollar sign $ and are case sensitive. They cannot start with a digit or a dollar sign.

integer var_a;        // Identifier contains alphabets and underscore -> Valid
integer $var_a;       // Identifier starts with $ -> Invalid
integer v$ar_a;       // Identifier contains alphabets and $ -> Valid
integer 2var;         // Identifier starts with a digit -> Invalid
integer var23_g;      // Identifier contains alphanumeric characters and underscore -> Valid
integer 23;           // Identifier contains only numbers -> Invalid
7. verilog keywords:
Keywords are special identifiers reserved to define the language constructs and are in lower case and cant be used as identifiers.
