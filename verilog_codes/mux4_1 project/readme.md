# 4:1 Multiplexer

---

## Introduction

A **4:1 multiplexer** (or 4-to-1 MUX) is a digital switch that channels one of four input signals to a single output line, based on the values of two control (or select) inputs. Think of it as a signal selector: at any given time, only *one* of the four inputs is routed to the output, depending on the binary value of the select lines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Inputs and Output

- **Data Inputs (I‚ÇÄ, I‚ÇÅ, I‚ÇÇ, I‚ÇÉ)**: Four separate binary inputs
- **Select Inputs (S‚ÇÄ, S‚ÇÅ)**: Two control lines to select one of the four inputs
- **Output (out)**: The resulting output that reflects the selected data input

## üìã Truth Table

```markdown
| S‚ÇÅ | S‚ÇÄ | Output out |
|----|----|----------|
| 0  | 0  | I‚ÇÄ       |
| 0  | 1  | I‚ÇÅ       |
| 1  | 0  | I‚ÇÇ       |
| 1  | 1  | I‚ÇÉ       |

```

Each row shows which data input gets passed through to the output **Y** based on the values of the select lines **S‚ÇÅ** and **S‚ÇÄ**.
